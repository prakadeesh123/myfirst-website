        <p><b> Cleanse and moisturize the face</b>
          
                                                     <br />   The first step in bridal makeup is to cleanse and moisturize the face. This ensures that the skin is clean, free of dirt and impurities, and well-hydrated. Start by using a gentle cleanser suitable for your skin type to remove any makeup residue or oils. Then, apply a moisturizer that suits your skin's needs to provide hydration and create a smooth canvas for makeup application. </p>
           <div class="imgone"> <img src="media/one.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div>                                          
       
                                                     <p><b> Prime the face</b>
                                                     <br />  Priming the face is essential for long-lasting makeup. Choose a primer that suits your skin type, whether it's oil-free for oily skin or hydrating for dry skin. Apply a thin layer of primer all over the face, focusing on areas prone to oiliness or large pores. This step helps to blur imperfections, minimize the appearance of pores, and create a smooth base for foundation.</p>
                                                     <div class="imgtwo"> <img src="media/two.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div> 
                                                     <p><b>Apply foundation</b> 
                                                       <br />     Foundation evens out the skin tone and provides a base for the rest of the makeup. Select a foundation that matches your skin tone and undertone. Use a foundation brush, sponge, or your fingers to apply the foundation evenly all over the face, blending it out towards the hairline and jawline. Make sure to blend it well into the skin for a seamless finish.</p>
                                                       <div class="imgthree"> <img src="media/three.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div> 
                                                       <p><b>Conceal imperfections</b> 
                                                       <br /> To cover any blemishes, dark circles, or discoloration, use a concealer that matches your skin tone. Apply it sparingly to the areas that need coverage, such as under the eyes, around the nose, or on any spots. Blend the concealer gently using a brush or your fingertips until it seamlessly merges with the foundation.</p>
                                                       <div class="imgfour"> <img src="media/four.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div> 
                                                       <p><b>Set with powder</b> 
                                                      <br />   To set the foundation and concealer, use a translucent or setting powder. Lightly dust the powder all over the face using a fluffy brush, focusing on the T-zone or any areas prone to oiliness. This step helps to control shine and extends the longevity of your makeup.</p>
                                                      <div class="imgfive"> <img src="media/five.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div> 
                                                      <p><b>Enhance the eyes</b> 
                                                    <br />  Bridal makeup often emphasizes the eyes, so start by applying an eyeshadow primer to ensure the eyeshadow stays in place. Choose eyeshadow shades that complement your eye color and wedding theme. Apply a lighter shade on the eyelids as a base, a medium shade in the crease for definition, and a highlight shade on the brow bone and inner corner of the eyes. Blend the eyeshadows well to create a seamless transition between colors. Finish with eyeliner, mascara, and false lashes if desired.</p>
                                                    <div class="imgsix"> <img src="media/six.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div>
                                                    <p><b>Define the brows</b> 
                                                       <br /> Well-defined eyebrows frame the face and complete the bridal look. Use an eyebrow pencil or powder to fill in any sparse areas and shape the brows. Brush them with a spoolie brush for a natural look. Apply a clear or tinted brow gel to set the brows in place throughout the day.</p>
                                                       <div class="imgseven"> <img src="media/seven.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div>
                                                       <p><b>Add color to the cheeks</b> 
                                                    <br /> Apply blush to add a natural flush to the cheeks. Choose a shade that complements your skin tone and apply it to the apples of the cheeks, blending it upwards towards the temples. Use a light hand to avoid a heavy or unnatural appearance.</p>
                                                    <div class="imgeight"> <img src="media/eight.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div> 
                                                    <p><b>Apply lip color</b> 
                                         <br />   Choose a lip color that complements your overall makeup look and your personal preferences. Line </p>
                                         <div class="imgnine"> <img src="media/nine.jpg" alt="" width="250px"></div> 
                                         <p><b>Highlight and contour</b> 
                                            <br /> For added dimension and glow, apply a subtle contour shade to define the cheekbones, jawline, and nose. Use a matte bronzer or contour powder that is slightly darker than your skin tone. Blend it well to create a natural shadow effect. Then, apply a highlighter to the high points of the face, such as the cheekbones, bridge of the nose, and Cupid's bow, to add a radiant glow.</p>
